abstract = {In this paper we prove a useful formula for the graded commutator of the Hodge codifferential with the left wedge multiplication by a fixed {\$}p{\$}-form acting on the de Rham algebra of a Riemannian manifold. Our formula generalizes a formula stated by Samuel I. Goldberg for the case of 1-forms. As first examples of application we obtain new identities on locally conformally Kaehler manifolds and quasi-Sasakian manifolds. Moreover, we prove that under suitable conditions a certain subalgebra of differential forms in a compact manifold is quasi-isomorphic as a CDGA to the full de Rham algebra.},
